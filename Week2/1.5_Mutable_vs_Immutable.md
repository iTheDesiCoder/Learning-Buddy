# Python Basics – Mutable vs Immutable

---

## 🔹 What Do Mutable and Immutable Mean?

- **Mutable** → Object **can be changed** after it is created.  
- **Immutable** → Object **cannot be changed** after it is created; any "modification" creates a **new object**.  

👉 In Python, **everything is an object**. The distinction is based on mutability, not primitive vs object.

## 🔹 Immutable Data Types

- `int`
- `float`
- `str`
- `tuple`
- `bool`
- `frozenset`

### Example with `int`
```python
x = 10
print(id(x))   # e.g., 140721455673808

x = x + 1      # creates a NEW int object
print(id(x))   # different id
```

### Example with `str`
```python
s = "hello"
print(id(s))

s = s.upper()   # new string created
print(id(s))    # different id
```

💡 **Takeaway**: Immutable objects are safe, predictable, and can be used as **keys in dicts** or **elements in sets**.

## 🔹 Mutable Data Types

- `list`
- `dict`
- `set`
- `bytearray`

### Example with `list`
```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(lst1))

lst1.append(4)   # modifies the same object
print(id(lst1))  # same id
print(lst1)      # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Example with `dict`
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(id(person))

person["age"] = 31   # in-place modification
print(id(person))    # same id
print(person)        # {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}
```

💡 **Takeaway**: Mutable objects allow in-place changes, which can cause **side effects** if multiple variables reference the same object.

## 🔹 Comparing Mutable vs Immutable

| Feature                | Mutable (list, dict, set)            | Immutable (int, str, tuple)     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Can modify in place?    | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No (new object created)       |
| `id()` after change     | Same id                             | Different id                    |
| Safe as dict keys?      | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                          |
| Performance             | May be slower if large              | Faster for hash lookups         |

## 🔹 How It Differs from Java / C#

- **Java/C#**: Distinction is **value types vs reference types**.  
  - Immutable → `String`, wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Double`).  
  - Mutable → `StringBuilder`, collections (`List`, `Dictionary`, `HashMap`).  
- **Python**: Simpler model → everything is an object; the key distinction is **mutable vs immutable**.

---

## 🔹 Real-World Example

### Bug from Mutability
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b.append(4)

print(a)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] → a changed too!
```

### Safer with Immutable
```python
a = (1, 2, 3)
b = a
# b[0] = 99   # ❌ TypeError, tuple is immutable

print(a)  # (1, 2, 3)
```

## 💡 Exercises

1. Create a string and try to modify a character (`s[0] = 'H'`). What happens?  
2. Create a list, assign it to another variable, and modify one. Do both change?  
3. Use `id()` to show that integers create new objects after modification.  
4. Try to use a `list` as a dictionary key. What error do you get?
