# Python `main` Function Convention

---

## 🔹 Why Do We Need a `main()` in Python?

- In **COBOL/Java/C#**: Programs have a fixed entry point (`PROGRAM-ID` in COBOL, `public static void main()` in Java/C#).  
- In **Python**: There is **no required main method** — the interpreter executes the file from top to bottom.  
- However, using a `main()` function is a **best practice** because:
  - Makes the entry point clear.  
  - Avoids accidental code execution when the file is imported.  
  - Improves readability and modularity.

## 🔹 The `__name__` Variable

- Python sets a special variable `__name__` in every module.  
- If the file is run directly → `__name__ == "__main__"`.  
- If the file is imported → `__name__` is set to the module name.  

---

## 🔹 Example Without `main`
```python
print("This runs immediately")

def greet():
    print("Hello from greet!")

greet()
```

- If this file is imported into another file, **all top-level code runs immediately**.  
- This is usually not desirable.  

---

## 🔹 Example With `main()`

```python
def main():
    print("This is the main function")

def greet():
    print("Hello from greet!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- When run directly → `This is the main function`.  
- When imported → nothing runs automatically, but `greet()` can still be called.  

---

## 🔹 Why It Matters

- **Organized Entry Point** → Like Java/C#, easy to find where execution begins.  
- **Reusable Code** → Functions and classes can be imported into other modules without side effects.  
- **Best Practice** → Standard in most production Python projects.

## 🔹 Real-World Example

### File: `app.py`
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def main():
    result = add(5, 7)
    print("Result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### File: `test_app.py`
```python
import app

print(app.add(3, 4))   # Works fine
# app.main() does not run automatically
```

## 🔹 Comparison with Other Languages

| Language   | Entry Point Example                 | Mandatory? | Notes |
|------------|-------------------------------------|------------|-------|
| COBOL      | `PROGRAM-ID. MYPROG.`               | ✅ Yes     | Always starts at PROCEDURE DIVISION |
| Java       | `public static void main(String[])` | ✅ Yes     | Fixed signature required |
| C#         | `static void Main(string[] args)`   | ✅ Yes     | Fixed signature required |
| Python     | `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` | ❌ No      | Convention, not enforced |

## 💡 Exercises

1. Write a simple program with a `main()` function that prints `"Welcome to Python"`.  
2. Create a helper function (e.g., `square(n)`) and call it inside `main()`.  
3. Import your program from another file — confirm that `main()` does not run automatically.
