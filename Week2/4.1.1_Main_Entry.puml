title Python Main vs Import Behavior

actor "Developer" as dev

rectangle "Test.py" {
  rectangle "main()" as main
  rectangle "Helper Functions\n(add, greet, etc.)" as funcs
}

rectangle "Python Interpreter" as interp

dev --> "Test.py" : Run or Import
"Test.py" --> interp

rectangle "Direct Run\npython Test.py" as run
rectangle "Imported as Module\nimport Test" as imp

run --> main : Executes if __name__ == '__main__'
imp --> funcs : Functions available for reuse
