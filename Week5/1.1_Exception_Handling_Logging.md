# Exception Handling with Logging in Python

In real-world Python applications, errors are not just displayed on the console — they are recorded in log files. 
This helps developers diagnose issues later without disturbing the end-user experience.

## 1. Basic Exception Handling (Reminder)

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!", e)
```

---

## 2. Why Logging Instead of Print?

- `print()` only shows the message on screen and disappears once the program ends.  
- `logging` records messages into a file that can be reviewed later.  
- Logs can capture different levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.

---

## 3. Setting Up Logging

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    filename="app.log",              # log file name
    level=logging.ERROR,             # capture only ERROR and above
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)
```

This configuration will save error messages into `app.log`.

## 4. Example: Handling File Errors with Logging

```python
import logging

# Configure logging once at the start
logging.basicConfig(
    filename="app.log",
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)

try:
    # Trying to open a missing file
    with open("scores_missing.txt", "r") as f:
        data = f.read()

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    logging.error("File not found: %s", e)
    print("Oops! Something went wrong. Please check app.log for details.")

except Exception as e:
    logging.exception("Unexpected error occurred")
    print("An unexpected error happened. See app.log.")
```

---

## 5. Sample `app.log` Output

```
2025-09-18 18:42:10,123 - ERROR - File not found: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'scores_missing.txt'
```

---

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Always use `logging` instead of `print` for real applications.  
- Different log levels help separate normal info from serious problems.  
- Logs provide a permanent record for debugging and audits.

✅ **Pro Tip for Teaching**:  
You can show students the difference by running the code once and then opening the generated `app.log` file.
