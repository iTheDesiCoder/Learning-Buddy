# Chapter 6: GroupBy in Pandas

In this chapter, we will learn about the powerful **GroupBy** functionality in Pandas.  
GroupBy allows us to split data into groups, apply operations, and then combine results.  
We will use **Customer.csv** and **Order.csv** for practice.

---

## 1. Intro to the GroupBy Module

GroupBy is often described as **Split ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Combine**.

---

## 2. The groupby Method

Example: Group orders by `SecurityType`.

```python
import pandas as pd

orders = pd.read_csv("Order.csv")
grouped = orders.groupby("SecurityType")
print(grouped["Qty"].sum())
```

---

## 3. Retrieve A Group with get_group Method

```python
print(grouped.get_group("Equity").head())
```

---

## 4. Methods on the GroupBy Object

Example: Find average order quantity per `SecurityType`.

```python
print(grouped["Qty"].mean())
```

---

## 5. Grouping by Multiple Columns

```python
multi_group = orders.groupby(["SecurityType", "SecurityName"])
print(multi_group["Qty"].sum().head())
```

---

## 6. The agg Method

Perform multiple aggregations.

```python
agg_results = orders.groupby("SecurityType").agg({
    "Qty": ["sum", "mean"],
    "Price": ["min", "max"]
})
print(agg_results)
```

---

## 7. Iterating through Groups

```python
for name, group in orders.groupby("SecurityType"):
    print(f"Group: {name}")
    print(group.head(2))
```

# üìù Practice Exercises

1. Find total quantity ordered for each SecurityType.  
2. Find average Price of each SecurityName.  
3. Group by AccountNumber and calculate total order value (`Qty * Price`).  
4. Use `.agg()` to compute min, max, and average Qty for each SecurityType.  
5. Iterate through groups of SecurityType and print first 3 rows of each.
