# Chapter 2: DataFrames II ‚Äì Filtering Data

In this chapter, we will learn how to filter and clean data using **Pandas**.  
We will use **Customer.csv** and **Order.csv** to practice.

---

## 1. Filter a DataFrame Based on a Condition

Example: Find customers with balance above 50,000.

```python
import pandas as pd

customers = pd.read_csv("Customer.csv")
print(customers[customers["AccountBalance"] > 50000].head())
```

---

## 2. Filter with More than One Condition (AND - &)

Example: Customers in NY with balance above 70,000.

```python
ny_rich = customers[(customers["State"] == "NY") & (customers["AccountBalance"] > 70000)]
print(ny_rich)
```

---

## 3. Filter with More than One Condition (OR - |)

Example: Customers either from CA **or** TX.

```python
ca_or_tx = customers[(customers["State"] == "CA") | (customers["State"] == "TX")]
print(ca_or_tx)
```

---

## 4. The isin Method

Example: Orders for Apple or Tesla.

```python
orders = pd.read_csv("Order.csv")
tech_orders = orders[orders["SecurityName"].isin(["Apple Inc.", "Tesla Inc."])]
print(tech_orders.head())
```

---

## 5. The isnull and notnull Methods

Example: Check for missing values in Customer data.

```python
print(customers[customers["AccountBalance"].isnull()])
print(customers[customers["AccountBalance"].notnull()])
```

---

## 6. The between Method

Example: Find customers with balances between 30,000 and 60,000.

```python
mid_customers = customers[customers["AccountBalance"].between(30000, 60000)]
print(mid_customers)
```

---

## 7. The duplicated Method

Example: Check duplicate CustomerNames.

```python
print(customers[customers["CustomerName"].duplicated()])
```

---

## 8. The drop_duplicates Method

Remove duplicate CustomerNames.

```python
unique_customers = customers.drop_duplicates(subset="CustomerName")
print(unique_customers.head())
```

---

## 9. The unique and nunique Methods

Example: Find unique states.

```python
print(customers["State"].unique())
print(customers["State"].nunique())
```

---

# üìù Practice Exercises

1. Find all customers from FL or NJ.  
2. Get all orders with Qty greater than 300.  
3. Show customers with balances between 40,000 and 80,000.  
4. Drop duplicate CustomerNames if any.  
5. Find how many unique SecurityNames exist in orders.
