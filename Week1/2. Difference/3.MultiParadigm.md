# Multi-Paradigm: Sequential + OOP + Functional

Python supports **multiple programming styles**:  
- **Sequential / Procedural** → simple scripts, line by line.  
- **Object-Oriented (OOP)** → classes, objects, inheritance.  
- **Functional** → map, filter, lambdas, comprehensions.  

This flexibility makes Python unique compared to languages that enforce a single style (e.g., Java = OOP, C = procedural).

---

## 1. Sequential / Procedural Style
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = []
for n in numbers:
    squares.append(n * n)

print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

## 2. Object-Oriented Style
```python
class Calculator:
    def square(self, n):
        return n * n

calc = Calculator()
print([calc.square(n) for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## 3. Functional Style
```python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))

print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
