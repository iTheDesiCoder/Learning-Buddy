# Dynamic Typing – Flexible Variables

In Python, variables don’t need a declared type.  
The type is decided at **runtime** and can change later.

## ✅ Python (Dynamic Typing)
```python
x = 10          # int
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

x = "Hello"     # now it's a string
print(type(x))  # <class 'str'>

x = [1, 2, 3]   # now it's a list
print(type(x))  # <class 'list'>
